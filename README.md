# Mediator

I sit between your domain model and the cold, cruel world.

## TODO

* Nested collections or objects, like `r.array :albums` or `r.obj
  :contact` in the example above. Should create a new mediator stack
  for each entry in the collection but somehow mark the current
  mediator as the parent.

* For `r.ids`, just value.map(&:id). Should check for `_ids` shortcut
  first though, but only if an explicit value isn't provided.

* Nested collections should always exist in rendered output even if
  they're empty or missing.

* Benchmarks and micro-opts, esp. around object allocation.

* Decent doco.
